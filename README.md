# Boom-like-zoom---UniversityHomework
the first wet homework of the course data structures for my simister
the files we wrote: everything except main1.cpp and library.h
the homework was done in pairs, we both worked together on deciding the structure and building the main functions, then we divided the work where i was mostly responsiple for the
implementation of the nodes and the avl tree and my partner was responsible for the linked list
we also wrote a dry file which explains the structure of the code
more details about the homework in the project.txt
