# Boom-like-zoom---UniversityHomework
the first wet homework of the course data structures for my semester<br>
the files we wrote: everything except main1.cpp and library.h<br>
the homework was done in pairs, we both worked together on deciding the structure and building the main functions, then we divided the work where i was mostly responsiple for the<br>
implementation of the nodes and the avl tree and my partner was responsible for the linked list<br>
we also wrote a dry file which explains the structure of the code<br>
more details about the homework in the project.txt
